        <p>The following are a collection of my favourite recipes. Many are passed down,
            and then tweaked to my own taste, some are invented by myself, and some are 
            learned from the internet. 
        </p>
        <p>I am going to treat this site (originally a starter project in web design for 
            The Odin Project) as a personal cookbook for all my favourite recipes. Until now 
            I've cooked all of these from memory, which doesn't always turn out as perfect 
            as I'd like them to. This way, with my thoughts and processes written out, I, and 
            maybe some other people as well, can spend more time cooking and eatin and less 
            time thinking. 
        </p>
        <p>I'll continue to update this as time goes on with more recipes, and updating 
            current recipes with original photos (current photos are from google). As I 
            start to learn CSS and JS on top of HTML, I'll see this website/blog turn into 
            something less raw and more refined. This website is marked as the first for my 
            programming/web design portfolio and the beginning of my journey into this market, 
            whether it stays a hobby or turns into a profession.
