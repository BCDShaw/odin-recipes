        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>My Grandpa on my Father's side happened to be a red-seal Chef, so you 
            can bet a lot of that skill was passed down to him. So it is safe to say 
            I have had a plethora of good cooking knowlede bestowed upon me growing up. 
            My Dad's cooking style differed from my Mom's in the way that he threw whatever 
            the hell looked like it goes together in a pot or pan and improvised along the way. 
            I will say this style of cooking is fantastic for creating some very interesting 
            dishes, which is how this one was born.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a quite simple dish, nothing impressive, but it is incredibly filling,
            comforting, and easy to make. This is something you could eat all day, everyday,
            no matter the weather, and is sure to turn a bad day good, at least for the 
            duration of the meal!
        </p>
        <p>It's basically a mac and cheese recipe, using a basic roux as the base, with 
            a lot of taco seasoning added, some ground beef, and some veggies (depending 
            on what you like). Dad always called it a ghoulash growing up, but I just like 
            to call it Taco Mac.
