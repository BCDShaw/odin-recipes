        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>This authentic Scottish recipe (minus the peas and carrots due to my 
            own preference) is the perfect meal for a cold winter night, sure 
            to keep you warm.
        </p>
        <p>This recipe was passed down to me by my Mother upon me moving out 
            for the first time, and has been a personal favourite for over
            a decade. It only seemed right to include it on my very first 
            website project for The Odin Project! It's become a classic comfort
            food in my household.
        </p>
        <p>Cooking has become somewhat of a passion of mine due to spending
            so much time with my Mother growing up. She passed a lot of her skills
            down to me and as such I had to make some tweaks to this recipe, so it 
            isn't <em>exactly</em> the same: instead of a typical sauce I decided
            to use a Guinness-based sauce as it pairs so nicely with the ground lamb. 
            Where I live it can be hard to find Guinness sometimes, though, so I've 
            also been using a Murphy's-based sauce. They're both Irish beers that go 
            great with lamb. Keep in mind Guinness is quite bitter.

            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>

            <li>Chopped Green Onions</li>
            <li>Shredded Cheddar Cheese (Optional)</li>
            <li>2-3 Russet Potatos (or Rutabaga. Fake meat is vegetarian.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahreneheit.</li>
            <li>Start by melting butter in a pan (don't be afraid to use too much!). 
                Add the ground lamb and seaason to taste. I like to do a pinch of 
                salt, and then to sprinkle a thin layer of the pepper, thyme, 
                rosemary, and garlic on top.
            </li>
            <li>Once the lamb is browned, sprinkle a thin layer of Flour 
                on top. This is to act as a thickening agent for the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Add the Guinness and heavy cream. Let it simmer down until it 
                is thickened to your preferred consistency (the thicker the better). 
                I like to mash the lamb with a spatula or potato masher while it is 
                simmering. This softens the lamb so it melts in your mouth. The longer 
                you simmer the beef, the softer it gets and the less bitter the 
                Guinness tastes.
            </li>
            <li>Next melt some more butter in a small saucepan. Add the corn,
                peas, and carrots. Season to taste with salt and pepper. On 
                low heat, let the veggies thaw.
            </li>
            <li>Skin the potatos and put a large pot of water on to boil.</li>
            <li>Cook the potatos in the water until soft. Remove from water and 
                mash in a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Add butter and heavy cream until it reaches your desired 
                consistency. I like it to feel almost whipped. Try to get it 
                as smooth as possible with no chunks.
            </li>
            <li>Add pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, green onions, 
                and cheddar cheese to taste.
            </li>
            <li>Next, get a ceramic baking dish. Add the beef layer, 
                then the veggie layer, then top with the mashed potatos.
            </li>
            <li>Put the dish in the oven and bake until golden and bubbling along 
                the sides.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the dish and serve! Letting it sit for a bit is a good 
                idea so you don't burn your mouth and to let the sauce set a bit 
                better.
            </li>
        </ol>
